# Movies JL - Movie Catalog | React Native with Expo üé•üìï

## Project Description üìñ

This is a React Native project developed with Expo, aimed at connecting to [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to retrieve detailed information about current movies and their actors. The application is designed as a catalog, allowing users to explore data on their favorite movies, cast members, similar movies, and search for specific movies within TMDb's database.
